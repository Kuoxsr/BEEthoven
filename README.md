# BEEthoven

Suppose you were stung directly on the forehead by a species of bee so vicious and terrible, it could only come from one place: Australia.

Further suppose that being hospitalized for an allergic reaction to said sting left you so traumatized that it ruins your enjoyment of Minecraft to be around bees, one of the most adorable mobs in the game.

Hence, BEEthoven was born; a resource pack that replaces bee sounds with Wolfgang Von Beethoven's beautiful music.

Never be triggered again.  Download this pack today and fill your world with the sounds of classical music instead of angry wings.
